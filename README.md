The requirements for the project are as follows:


    Separates all database/business logic using the MVC pattern.

    Data can be viewed, added, updated, and deleted.
    Has a history of commits from both team members to a Git repository.
    Uses OOP, and defines multiple classes, including at least one inheritance relationship.
    Contains full Docblocks for all PHP files.
    Has full validation on the client side through JavaScript and server side through PHP.
    Incorporates jQuery and Ajax.
    BONUS:  Utilizes an API

1. We kept all database and business logic separate from each other and views but implementing an MVC patten.
This is apparent from the models, views and controller folders.

2. We made heavy use of templating in our views, and every page routed to itself or another.

3. PDO used for all database interactions.

4. Data can be added and updated.

5. Both team members contributed to the project and worked side by side

6. Use of both a Question class for the object, and an interface meets our OOP requirements.

7. All php files, and JS files that were created by ourselves have full documentation

8. PHP and JS both validate user input to ensure full protection

9. jQuery and Ajax are used heavily for the main game

BONUS: The game itself utilizes an API for each question.
